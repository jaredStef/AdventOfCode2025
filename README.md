| 2   | ✅      | ✅      |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3   | ✅      | ✅      |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4   | ✅      | ✅      |                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5   | ✅      | ✅      | The first problem where brute forcing would not work. Initally, I used a tree class with references, but merging duplicates was annoying so I switched.   |
| 6   | ✅      | ✅      | Not bad. The input for the second was annoying. I made some assumptions about the formatting of the example that did not hold true for the whole dataset. |
